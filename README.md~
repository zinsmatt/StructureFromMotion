# StructureFromMotion

 I developed a 3D reconstruction algorithm as part of a computer vision course.
The goal was to reconstruct a scene in 3D using two successive images from the KITTI Vision Benchmark.
The project was developed on Matlab with the Image Processing Toolbox and Peter Kovesi's toolbox (http://www.peterkovesi.com/matlabfns/index.html).


Algorithm :

- Interest points detection using the Harris detector on both images</li>
- Matching by correlation of the detected points</li>
- Robust estimation of the fundamental matrix</li>
- Projection matrices reconstruction in the two images</li>
- Computation of the 3D structure by triangulation</li>
